## An overview of the project and its purpose
### The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
### Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
- Import the data provided in the establishments.json file from your Terminal. Name the database uk_food and the collection establishments. Copy the text you used to import your data from your Terminal to a markdown cell in your notebook.

### Part 2: Update the Database
- Use NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge.
- The magazine editors have some requested modifications for the database before you can perform any queries or analysis for them. Make the following changes to the establishments collection:
- An exciting new halal restaurant just opened in Greenwich, but hasn't been rated yet. The magazine has asked you to include it in your analysis. Add the following information to the database:

### Part 3: Update the Database
- Eat Safe, Love has specific questions they want you to answer, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid.
  
## At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
- At the beginning everything was fine since most of the 1st part came in the exercises of the class, from the second day of class there were similar codes, with similar exercises on the third day of class, when I did not know what to write or did not understand the code, I deepened with BlackBox.ai each part of the code.
